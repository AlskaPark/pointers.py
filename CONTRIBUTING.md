## Running tests

Pointers.py uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) for running tests.

To get pre-commit running, simply run the following:

```
$ pip install pre-commit
$ pre-commit install
```

Then, just install pytest:

```
$ pip install pytest
```
